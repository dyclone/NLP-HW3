    Hw3_test.txt
        - Text file of the test sentences for the program

    Q2.py
        - Uses a NER tool that was trained in order to predict NEs on the sentences given in HW3_test.txt

        - How to run:
            * To run the program have HW3_test.txt be in the same directory as Q2.py and run Q2.py

            * The program will go through each sentence from the Hw3_test.txt file and use the NER tool. For each sentence
              a window will pop up displaying a sentence tree of each word in the sentence along with their POS tag and NE
              tag if it has any. The console will also display the same information that is in the sentence tree. To move
              on to the next sentence click the close button on the pop up window. Repeat the process for the rest of the
              sentences and observe the predictions of NE on the given sentences.
